    description: "Nestled in the heart of Wilson County, Cedars of Lebanon State Park preserves one of the largest remaining red cedar forests in the United States — a living relic of the vast cedar glades that once blanketed Middle Tennessee's limestone basin. Across 900 acres of fragrant cedar woodland and rare limestone glade ecosystems, visitors discover a landscape unlike anywhere else in the Southeast. The park's cedar glades harbor dozens of plant species found nowhere else on Earth, including the Tennessee coneflower, once thought extinct and now a celebrated conservation success story. Miles of trails wind through cathedral-like groves where ancient Eastern red cedars stand sentinel over carpets of limestone fern and glade wildflowers. The park's eight miles of hiking trails range from gentle woodland strolls to immersive backcountry loops, while the Dixon Merritt Nature Trail offers an accessible introduction to glade ecology. A spring-fed swimming pool, horseback riding trails, and well-appointed cabins make this a year-round destination for families and nature enthusiasts alike. The surrounding cedar forest teems with wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and a remarkable diversity of songbirds, while the limestone glows golden in late afternoon light — a photographer's paradise in every season.",

The park's crown jewel is the legendary Fiery Gizzard Trail, consistently ranked among the top hiking trails in America, a punishing 12.5-mile odyssey through boulder fields, past crystal swimming holes, and along knife-edge ridgelines with views stretching to the distant Smokies. Foster Falls plunges 60 feet into a natural amphitheater of moss-draped stone, drawing rock climbers from across the nation to its overhanging sandstone walls. Grundy Forest's old-growth hemlocks tower above a labyrinth of cascading creeks, while Savage Gulf's 55-foot Stone Door provides a dramatic portal into one of the deepest gorges east of the Mississippi. This is Tennessee at its most untamed — a landscape of cathedral forests, rare salamanders, and silence so deep you can hear the mountain breathe.",

    description: "Few parks in the American South deliver such concentrated natural drama as Burgess Falls, where the Falling Water River descends through a succession of four increasingly spectacular waterfalls over the course of a single mile-and-a-half trail. The journey begins gently, with a broad cascade shimmering over ledges of ancient limestone, then builds to a crescendo at the park's namesake — a breathtaking 136-foot curtain of whitewater thundering into a turquoise plunge pool carved from 300-million-year-old rock. The trail hugs the river's edge through a corridor of towering tulip poplars, sycamores, and hemlocks, with each bend revealing a new cascade more dramatic than the last. Spring brings carpets of trillium and bloodroot to the forest floor, while autumn transforms the gorge into a gallery of scarlet and gold reflected in the emerald pools below. A designated State Natural Area, Burgess Falls protects one of Middle Tennessee's most pristine riverine ecosystems — a sanctuary for great blue herons, belted kingfishers, and the occasional river otter spotted playing in the pools beneath the falls.",

This 1,368-acre State Natural Area cradles an 85-acre lake in a bowl of forested hills where white-tailed deer step delicately through morning mist, great horned owls call from century-old oaks, and wild turkeys strut along trails mere minutes from Nashville's skyline. The lake was originally impounded in 1914 by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad to provide water for steam engines, and the surrounding forest has been regenerating into mature hardwood woodland ever since. Today, six miles of trails loop through a tapestry of upland oak-hickory forest, cedar glades, and lakeshore wetlands that support over 240 species of birds — making Radnor one of the premier birding destinations in the interior Southeast. The park's strict protections — no jogging, no pets, no bicycles, no swimming — create an atmosphere of contemplative stillness rare in modern America. At dawn, when fog lifts off the lake and a barred owl's call echoes through the hollow, Nashville feels a thousand miles away.",

Each June, the world's largest natural rhododendron garden erupts into bloom across 600 acres of mountainside, painting the high balds in swaths of pink and magenta that have drawn pilgrims since the days when a grand resort hotel graced the summit in the 1880s. But Roan Mountain's wonders extend far beyond rhododendron season. The park's grassy balds — mysterious treeless meadows whose origins still puzzle scientists — offer 360-degree panoramas stretching from Mount Mitchell to the Virginia highlands, while rare spruce-fir forests cloak the upper elevations in a boreal ecosystem more typical of Canada than the American South. The 2,006-acre park at the mountain's base wraps around the headwaters of the Doe River, where native brook trout flash in pools shaded by old-growth hemlocks. Winter brings crystalline hoarfrost and snow-covered balds that rival any alpine scene on the continent, while spring carpets the forest floor in a procession of wildflowers — trout lily, bloodroot, and the rare Gray's lily, found only in these mountains.",

Today, this 15,000-acre shallow lake is a flooded forest of ghostly bald cypress trees draped in Spanish moss, their ancient knees rising from tea-dark water like sentinels of a drowned world. From December through March, Reelfoot becomes the winter home of one of the largest concentrations of American bald eagles in the interior United States, drawing thousands of visitors for ranger-led eagle tours aboard heated pontoon boats. The lake's labyrinthine channels harbor some of the finest crappie and bluegill fishing in the nation, while its marshes and mudflats support vast colonies of wading birds — great blue herons, great egrets, and the occasional American white pelican wheeling overhead in spiraling flocks.

    description: "Set among the rolling hills of Dickson County, Montgomery Bell State Park is Middle Tennessee's premier year-round retreat — a 3,850-acre refuge of hardwood forests, tranquil lakes, and restored 19th-century iron industry heritage. Three spring-fed lakes mirror the surrounding canopy of oak, hickory, and sweetgum, their still surfaces broken only by the rings of rising bluegill and the languid glide of great blue herons. The park's 117-room Lodge at Lake Acorn, extensively renovated and reopened, offers full-service comfort with a restaurant overlooking the water, while 28 miles of trails wind through forests where iron furnace ruins stand as silent monuments to the industrial empire of ironmaster Montgomery Bell, whose operations helped arm the Confederacy and shape the region's economy. The park's peaceful atmosphere belies its historical significance — the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was organized here in 1810, and Bell's iron operations represented one of the most advanced industrial complexes in the antebellum South. Today, golfers enjoy the rolling 18-hole course, paddlers explore the quiet coves of Lake Woodhaven, and families gather at the lakeside swimming beach as fireflies emerge at dusk to light the forest like a galaxy of earthbound stars.",

What was once overfarmed, eroded terrain — so exhausted that it was among the first properties acquired by the federal Resettlement Administration in the 1930s — has regenerated into a vast tapestry of mature hardwood and pine forest, rolling meadows, and four lakes that together create the finest equestrian park in the state. With 250 miles of horseback riding trails winding through forests and across gentle ridgelines, Natchez Trace draws riders from across the Southeast to its purpose-built wrangler campgrounds. The Pin Oak Lodge perches above one of the park's lakes, its 47 renovated rooms offering comfortable accommodations with panoramic water views. For anglers, the four lakes yield bass, bluegill, and catfish in a setting of almost preternatural quiet. The park's very existence tells the story of conservation at its most hopeful: land that was destroyed by poor agricultural practices, healed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and returned to a wildness that now shelters deer, turkey, bobcat, and the occasional bald eagle soaring above the pine canopy.",

The park's centerpiece is the Great Falls, where the Caney Fork plunges over a broad horseshoe dam into a swirling emerald pool surrounded by towering sandstone bluffs. Below the falls, Twin Falls drops in twin ribbons of white through a narrow gorge, accessible by a trail that descends through layers of geological time exposed in the canyon walls. The park's natural swimming areas — broad pools of crystalline water at the base of cascades — are among the most popular wild swimming spots in the state, drawing crowds on summer weekends who come to float in water so clear you can count the pebbles twenty feet down. Above the gorges, the park's uplands offer quiet hiking through mixed hardwood forest and along the rim of the Caney Fork Gorge, with overlooks that frame the river's emerald ribbon hundreds of feet below. The remains of a 19th-century textile mill add historical texture to a landscape that has been harnessing the power of falling water for centuries.",

    description: "Hidden in a narrow gorge of the Blackburn Fork River in Jackson County, Cummins Falls is Tennessee's eighth largest waterfall and one of the state's most rewarding natural adventures. The 75-foot cascade crashes over a broad limestone ledge into a deep, crystalline swimming hole of almost surreal blue-green clarity — a natural infinity pool carved into bedrock over millennia. What makes Cummins Falls extraordinary is the journey to reach it: a rugged, unimproved trail that crosses the river multiple times, scrambles over river boulders, and wades through knee-deep pools before revealing the falls in a sudden, breathtaking reveal around a final bend. This is not a drive-up waterfall — it's an earned experience, and the effort makes the reward all the sweeter. The gorge's microclimate creates a lush, fern-draped environment where maidenhair ferns cling to mist-soaked rock faces and water-polished limestone glows in every shade of cream and gold. Designated a State Park in 2012 after years of grassroots advocacy, Cummins Falls now requires an access permit for the gorge — a necessary measure to protect both the fragile environment and the visitors who come to experience one of Tennessee's most magical natural sanctuaries.",

The surrounding countryside is steeped in Civil War history — the Battle of Shiloh was fought just miles away — and the Tennessee River itself was a critical strategic corridor throughout the war. Today, the park's 1,400 acres blend modern resort amenities with natural beauty: sunsets over the lake paint the sky in watercolors of peach and violet, while bald eagles patrol the dam tailwaters and osprey dive for shad in the open water.

Seven original stone cabins offer overnight guests the rare experience of sleeping in historic buildings that embody the craftsmanship of a bygone era, with walls of hand-cut stone two feet thick and massive stone fireplaces that have warmed visitors for nine decades. Byrd Lake, a 50-acre impoundment nestled in a bowl of mixed hardwood forest, serves as the park's centerpiece — its mirror-still surface reflecting the surrounding canopy in autumn's full glory. The Bear Trace at Cumberland Mountain golf course has been ranked among the top ten public courses in North America by Golf Magazine, its rolling fairways carved through native forest with views stretching across the plateau. Mountain biking trails weave through the forest understory, and the park's trail system connects to the larger Cumberland Trail — a still-growing footpath that will eventually stretch 300 miles from Cumberland Gap to Chattanooga.",

    description: "Deep in the rugged Cumberland Mountains of Morgan County, Frozen Head State Park protects 24,000 acres of some of the most remote and biologically rich forest in the eastern United States. The park takes its name from Frozen Head Mountain, whose 3,324-foot summit — the highest point on the Cumberland Plateau — collects ice and frost long after the surrounding lowlands have warmed to spring. This is wild, uncompromising mountain country: steep-sided hollows cloak old-growth hemlock and poplar, more than a dozen waterfalls cascade through rhododendron-choked gorges, and the park's 80+ miles of trails traverse terrain so challenging that it hosts the legendary Barkley Marathons — an invitation-only ultramarathon so brutal that in most years no runner finishes at all. But Frozen Head rewards those who venture beyond the trailhead with treasures found nowhere else: spring wildflower displays rivaling the Great Smokies, breeding populations of rare cerulean warblers in the canopy overhead, and a silence so complete that on still mornings you can hear the wingbeats of ravens passing above the ridge. The park's rehabilitation from decades of coal mining damage makes its current wildness all the more remarkable — proof that given time and protection, even the most scarred landscapes can return to glory.",

Poplar Tree Lake, an oxbow lake left behind by the river's ancient wanderings, provides still-water paddling through corridors of cypress and tupelo, while the park's 20 miles of trails wind through a living encyclopedia of bottomland ecology — sweetgum, overcup oak, swamp chestnut oak, and persimmon rising from soil enriched by millennia of Mississippi floods. For birders, Meeman-Shelby is a revelation: prothonotary warblers flash golden among the cypress knees, barred owls trade eerie calls across the swamp, and during migration seasons the forest canopy comes alive with warblers, tanagers, and vireos refueling on their journey along the Mississippi Flyway.

The park's cabins — a mix of vintage CCC-era rustic and modern deluxe — overlook the lake through screens of dogwood and redbud that ignite with blossoms each April. A seasonal swimming pool and lakeside boat dock provide summer recreation, while miles of trails wind through forests rich in wildflowers, ferns, and the distinctive layered sandstone formations that characterize the plateau's geology.

Center Hill Lake itself, a 18,220-acre reservoir of the Caney Fork River, has earned a reputation as one of Tennessee's cleanest and most beautiful lakes, its cool, deep waters supporting a thriving population of walleye, smallmouth bass, and striped bass. The park's marina provides boat rentals and slip access, while the Millennium Trail winds along the ridge through mature oak-hickory forest with periodic overlooks offering sweeping views across the lake to the distant plateau. Rustic cabins tucked into the forest canopy provide accommodation that feels genuinely remote despite the park's easy access from Interstate 40.

The Stone Door, a massive crack in the plateau rim that served as a passageway for Native Americans descending into the gulf, remains the park's most famous feature — a narrow slot canyon that opens onto a vertiginous overlook 900 feet above the gulf floor. From this natural portal, the view stretches across a sea of unbroken forest filling the gorge below, a canopy so vast and primeval it recalls what much of the eastern United States looked like before European settlement. The gulf system encompasses three major gorges and over 55 miles of trails ranging from gentle rim walks to strenuous descents to the creek-laced floor, where virgin hemlock and tulip poplar tower above streams flowing over beds of ancient sandstone. Greeter Falls, a stunning double waterfall accessible by a shorter trail, provides a more approachable introduction to the gulf's grandeur.

The river's gorges are intimate and dramatic: sheer sandstone walls rising 80 to 500 feet above boulder-strewn rapids, their faces adorned with curtains of wild hydrangea, hemlock, and rhododendron that soften the raw geometry of the stone. World-class rock climbing routes line the gorge walls, drawing climbers from across the nation to crack systems and overhanging faces of bullet-hard Rockcastle conglomerate. When water levels are right, the Obed and Clear Creek offer technical Class III-IV whitewater through continuous boulder gardens — a wild, committing run through gorges so deep and narrow that once you launch, the only way out is downstream. Below the rapids, quiet pools of emerald water invite swimming, while the surrounding plateau forests support populations of rare mussels, hellbender salamanders, and a diversity of aquatic life that earned the rivers their Wild and Scenic designation.",

Today, Stones River National Battlefield preserves 570 acres of this hallowed ground, where limestone cedar glades and open meadows are dotted with cannon positions, monuments, and the somber ranks of white headstones in Stones River National Cemetery — the oldest national cemetery established during the Civil War. The park's auto tour and walking trails guide visitors through the battle's key phases: the devastating Confederate dawn attack through the Round Forest, the desperate Union stand along the Nashville Pike, and the final Union assault across McFadden's Ford that decided the battle's outcome. The landscape itself tells the story — the cedar glades that provided concealment, the limestone outcrops that served as natural breastworks, and the river crossing where the battle reached its climax. Beyond its military significance, the battlefield preserves some of the finest remaining examples of Middle Tennessee's rare cedar glade ecosystem, supporting several plant species found nowhere else on Earth.",

The Treetop Skywalk — a 880-foot elevated walkway suspended among the ancient hardwood canopy — offers eye-level encounters with a forest that clings to the steep mountainside in defiant beauty, every branch draped in lichens and resurrection fern. Far below, the AnaVista Tower provides 360-degree panoramas that sweep from the Great Smoky Mountains' blue ridges to the twinkling lights of Gatlinburg's strip, a visual essay in the contrast between wilderness and tourism that defines this corner of Appalachia. The Dueling Zipline Adventure sends riders soaring over the forest canopy at speeds that blur the distinction between flight and falling, while Memorial Forest — a living tribute of native trees — grounds the experience in quiet reflection. Treehouse Village showcases whimsical structures nested among the treetops, each one a marvel of rustic engineering and childlike imagination. The mountain's native gardens bloom with rhododendron, mountain laurel, and azalea from April through June, painting the slopes in watercolors of pink, white, and flame orange. Evening transforms Anakeesta into a firefly's dreamscape, with thousands of LED lights illuminating the canopy walkway in patterns that echo the synchronized fireflies for which the Smokies are world-famous.",

    description: "Deep within the ancient limestone heart of Lookout Mountain, Ruby Falls harbors one of America's most extraordinary natural wonders — a 145-foot underground waterfall thundering through a cavern that has remained sealed from the outside world for millions of years. The journey begins with an elevator descent 260 feet into solid rock, then follows a winding passage through a subterranean gallery of stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone draperies, and formations so fantastical they seem sculpted by a hand more patient than time itself. Around each bend, the cave reveals new architectural marvels: crystal-clear pools reflecting formations overhead, columns where stalactites and stalagmites have merged over millennia, and delicate soda straws so fragile a whisper might shatter them. The climax — the waterfall itself — appears suddenly in a vast cathedral chamber, its waters plummeting from an opening in the ceiling into a pool surrounded by carefully designed lighting that transforms the cascade into a spectacle of color and shadow. Above ground, the Lookout Mountain Tower provides breathtaking views of the Tennessee Valley stretching to the horizon, a landscape carved by the same ancient waters that hollowed the caverns below. The ZIPstream Aerial Adventure and High Point climbing wall offer above-ground thrills for those who prefer their adventures in open air. Ruby Falls has captivated visitors since its discovery in 1928 by explorer Leo Lambert, making it one of the longest continuously operated underground attractions in the United States.",

The three-mile driving loop winds past herds of zebra grazing alongside American bison, giraffes stretching their improbable necks toward offered treats, and ostriches sprinting alongside vehicles with startling speed and comic determination. Feed buckets provided at the entrance transform every family car into a safari vehicle, and the animals — acclimated to visitors but never fully domesticated — approach with a curiosity that erases the barrier between observer and observed. Beyond the drive-through, a walk-through area houses a petting zoo where goats, lambs, and miniature donkeys compete for attention with the unrestrained enthusiasm that only baby animals can muster. Exotic bird aviaries, camel rides, and seasonal festivals round out an experience that manages to be simultaneously educational and pure, uncomplicated fun.

Twelve distinct garden areas flow across the property's natural contours: the Bracken Foundation Children's Garden ignites young imaginations with interactive water features and plant tunnels, while the Japanese Garden offers contemplative stillness around a koi-filled stream that murmurs through mossy boulders beneath a canopy of Japanese maples ablaze in autumn scarlet. The Carell Woodland Sculpture Trail weaves contemporary art installations through a mature forest of tulip poplars, beeches, and oaks — a gallery without walls where art and nature exist in continuous dialogue. Spring brings one of Nashville's most spectacular displays: over 150,000 tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths blooming in choreographed waves of color that transform the formal gardens into a living Impressionist canvas. The estate's seasons each carry their own signature — summer's riot of daylilies and roses, fall's fiery foliage against the mansion's warm limestone, winter's ethereal Holiday LIGHTS celebration that draws hundreds of thousands through a mile of illuminated gardens.

What was once an industrial landscape of marble quarries and limestone extraction has been transformed — through decades of patient ecological restoration — into a wild corridor that would be remarkable anywhere, and is extraordinary within sight of a city skyline. The centerpiece is Mead's Quarry, a flooded former marble quarry whose emerald waters are now a beloved swimming and paddling destination, its sheer rock walls rising 40 feet from crystal-clear water that shifts from jade to sapphire depending on the season and angle of light. Over 12 miles of trails wind through river bluff forests thick with tulip poplar and sycamore, past natural springs and limestone outcrops adorned with walking fern and wild columbine, and along the Tennessee River's rocky shoreline where great blue herons fish in morning mist. The Will Skelton Greenway connects Ijams to Knoxville's broader urban trail network, making it possible to ride a bicycle from downtown to deep woods in twenty minutes. The Navul Trail — constructed on the abandoned right-of-way of an old naval mine facility — threads through a unique landscape where concrete bunkers are slowly being reclaimed by oak and hickory forest, a poignant meditation on nature's patient victory over industry. Ijams' environmental education programs, canoe and kayak rentals, rock climbing walls, and mountain bike trails make this the outdoor heartbeat of Knoxville — a place where the city exhales into the wild and the wild breathes back.",

    description: "Encompassing 4,500 acres in the heart of the Memphis metropolitan area, Shelby Farms Park is one of the largest urban parks in the United States — five times the size of New York's Central Park and a testament to Memphis's ambitious vision for urban green space. What began as a county penal farm has been transformed into a world-class recreational landscape that seamlessly blends natural habitat preservation with active outdoor recreation across a terrain of rolling meadows, mature hardwood forests, and the shimmering expanse of Hyde Lake. The Shelby Farms Greenline — a paved multi-use trail stretching over 10 miles from midtown Memphis to the park's western boundary — serves as the primary artery of Memphis's growing greenway network, drawing joggers, cyclists, and rollerbladers through a linear park that connects neighborhoods to nature. Within the park, 40 miles of trails accommodate every ambition: paved paths for families with strollers, singletrack for mountain bikers seeking technical challenge, and equestrian trails winding through bottomland hardwood forests where red-tailed hawks circle overhead and white-tailed deer browse at forest edges. The Go Ape aerial adventure course sends visitors swinging through the forest canopy on ziplines and Tarzan swings, while Hyde Lake offers paddleboarding, kayaking, and fishing for largemouth bass and catfish. Woodland Discovery Playground — one of the most imaginative public playgrounds in the South — features climbing structures, water play, and nature-inspired play elements designed to reconnect children with the outdoors. The park's buffalo herd — a small group of American bison grazing in view of the Memphis skyline — serves as a living reminder of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem that once covered this region, a landscape so thoroughly transformed by agriculture that its echoes are now curated curiosities.",

    description: "Nestled in a mountain basin surrounded by 3,550 acres of protected Appalachian forest in the Tri-Cities region, Bays Mountain Park stands as one of the largest city-owned nature preserves in the United States — and quite possibly the most surprising. That a small city like Kingsport, Tennessee would possess a nature reserve of this scale and quality speaks to a deep regional reverence for the mountain landscapes that define upper East Tennessee. The park's centerpiece is a 44-acre lake encircled by old-growth forest where eastern hemlock, white pine, and tulip poplar tower above a lush understory of rhododendron and mountain laurel. Over 40 miles of trails traverse terrain ranging from lakeside boardwalks to rugged ridge-top paths with views that stretch across the Holston Valley to the distant Blue Ridge. The nature center houses a state-of-the-art planetarium — the largest in the Tri-Cities region — where laser shows and astronomical programs illuminate the same night skies that Appalachian settlers navigated by centuries ago. A raptor center shelters non-releasable birds of prey — bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls — offering intimate encounters with raptors that would otherwise be glimpsed only as silhouettes against mountain horizons. The park's wolf enclosure, featuring a pack of gray wolves, provides one of the few opportunities in Tennessee to observe these apex predators in a naturalistic setting. A working farmstead demonstrates the agricultural heritage of the Appalachian highlands, while the barge ride across the lake offers the singular experience of floating through mountain forest in absolute silence, the only sound the drip of water from the paddle and the distant call of a wood thrush echoing through the hollow.",

    description: "Built for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games as the venue for canoe and kayak slalom events, the Ocoee Whitewater Center occupies a spectacular stretch of the Ocoee River gorge in the Cherokee National Forest of southeast Tennessee — where the river carves through Precambrian metamorphic rock in a continuous series of Class III-IV rapids that rank among the most exhilarating commercially rafted whitewater in the eastern United States. The Olympic legacy course — a man-made channel carved alongside the natural river — remains in use as a training venue for competitive paddlers, its gates still hanging above technical drops that challenged the world's finest athletes. But the true glory of the Ocoee lies in the natural river itself: five miles of continuous whitewater through a forested gorge where rhodendron-draped boulders the size of houses create hydraulics, pour-overs, and standing waves that have earned rapid names like 'Broken Nose,' 'Double Trouble,' and 'Hell Hole.' Multiple licensed outfitters launch guided raft trips daily during release season, making the Ocoee accessible to first-time rafters and seasoned paddlers alike. When the river isn't running, the gorge transforms into a hiking and mountain biking destination of considerable beauty, with the Thunder Rock Trail climbing through oak-hickory forest to overlooks where the river appears as a silver ribbon threading through an impossibly green gorge. The Forest Service visitor center interprets both the Olympic history and the gorge's geological story — a tale of continental collision, mountain building, and the patient work of water that spans a billion years.",

Spread across 160 acres of forested hillside, the park's architecture reflects the rustic beauty of an Appalachian mountain village, with log structures, working blacksmith shops, glass-blowing studios, and craftspeople demonstrating traditions that stretch back to the earliest settlers of these mountains. The Craftsman's Valley area alone features over a dozen master artisans practicing skills — candle dipping, leather working, wagon making — that would otherwise exist only in museum exhibits. But Dollywood's heart beats loudest in its music: the park's stages host over 40 live shows daily during peak season, from bluegrass and gospel to country and rock, in venues ranging from intimate chapel settings to the 4,000-seat Celebrity Theater. The ride collection balances family-friendly attractions with genuine adrenaline machines — Wild Eagle, the nation's first wing coaster, sends riders soaring above the treetops with an unobstructed view of the Smoky Mountain foothills, while Lightning Rod, the world's first launched wooden roller coaster, rockets from zero to 73 mph in the time it takes to draw a breath. The adjacent Dollywood's Splash Country water park and the DreamMore Resort extend the experience beyond the gates. Seasonal festivals — Festival of Nations in spring, Smoky Mountain Summer Celebration, Harvest Festival with its spectacular Great Pumpkin LumiNights, and Smoky Mountain Christmas with five million holiday lights — transform the park into a year-round cultural destination.",

Today, the mountain's Tennessee face is home to a constellation of natural attractions that collectively rank among the most visited in the Southeast. Rock City Gardens, perched atop the mountain's dramatic bluff line, threads visitors through a natural garden of massive sandstone formations, including the legendary Lover's Leap overlook where — on a clear day — seven states are visible in a single panoramic sweep that stretches from the Blue Ridge to the Cumberland Plateau. The Enchanted Trail winds through a fantasy landscape of gnome grottos and fairy tale displays nested among ancient rock formations draped in native plants, culminating at the 100-foot Lover's Leap waterfall. Rock City's garden collection includes over 400 species of native plants, many of them rare Appalachian endemics that thrive in the mountain's unique microclimate of sandstone crevices, dripping springs, and dappled shade. The Incline Railway — billed as 'America's Most Amazing Mile' — climbs a 72.7% grade up the mountain's face, making it one of the steepest passenger railways in the world. At the summit, Point Park (a unit of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park) preserves the Civil War battlefield with monuments, cannons, and interpretive displays that bring the November 1863 engagement to vivid life against the backdrop of the same breathtaking valley views that soldiers from both armies gazed upon in wonder between the volleys.",
