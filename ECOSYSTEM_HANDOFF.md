# Verdara (App #28) — Ecosystem Integration Handoff

## About This Document
Verdara is requesting integration with your service within the DarkWave Trust Layer ecosystem. Below you'll find what Verdara has already implemented, what it needs from your service, and a **Return Handoff Template** at the bottom for you to fill out and send back.

---

## What Verdara Already Has
- **Trust Layer SSO:** JWT-based authentication using shared `JWT_SECRET` (HS256). Users authenticate via `/api/chat/auth/login` and receive a JWT containing `userId`, `trustLayerId`, and `iss: "trust-layer-sso"`.
- **Trust Layer IDs:** Every user is assigned a Trust Layer ID in `tl-xxxx-xxxx` format, stored in `chat_users.trust_layer_id`.
- **Signal Chat:** Real-time WebSocket messaging (`/ws/chat`) with JWT-authenticated connections, channel-based messaging, typing indicators, and presence tracking.
- **Tech Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript frontend, Express.js + TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, hosted on Replit.
- **Existing Payment Integration:** Stripe Checkout for the wood economy marketplace.
