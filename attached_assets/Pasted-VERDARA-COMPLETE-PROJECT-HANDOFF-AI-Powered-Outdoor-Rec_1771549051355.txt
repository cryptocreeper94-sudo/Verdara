VERDARA COMPLETE PROJECT HANDOFF
AI-Powered Outdoor Recreation Super-App
Version 1.0 | February 2026 | verdara.io

🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Verdara is a comprehensive AI-powered outdoor recreation super-app combining nature identification, complete outdoor activities suite, professional arborist business management, wood economy marketplace, trip planning with campground booking, deep sea fishing/big game hunting charters, survival hub, conservation education, and universal price comparison across 50+ outdoor retailers.

Parent Company: DarkWave Studios (weather widget integration will be internal/custom resource)

Brand Positioning: Premium outdoor recreation platform focused on nature-based activities. Explicitly EXCLUDES team sports (baseball, football, golf, tennis, indoor fitness) to maintain authentic outdoor brand identity.

🎬 FIRST BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: Update Tailwind Config
Add custom colors to tailwind.config.ts:

theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      emerald: { DEFAULT: '#10b981' },
      slate: { DEFAULT: '#64748b' },
      amber: { DEFAULT: '#f59e0b' },
      forest: { DEFAULT: '#065f46' },
      earth: { DEFAULT: '#78350f' },
    },
    backdropBlur: {
      xl: '20px',
      '2xl': '30px',
    },
  },
}
Step 2: Create Glass Components
Build reusable GlassCard, GlassNav, GlassButton components

Step 3: Set Up Routing
Configure Wouter routes for 6 screens

Step 4: Build Homepage
Hero with photorealistic forest background
Activity category bento grid (12 cards with real images)
Featured trails carousel
Step 5: Build AI Identification Screen
Upload interface
Mock analysis animation
Results display with accordion
Step 6: Build Remaining Screens
Trail Discovery
Trip Planner
Wood Marketplace
User Dashboard
✅ DEFINITION OF DONE (Phase 1 Mockup)
 All 6 screens navigable via routing
 Every card has a photorealistic image (NO gray placeholders)
 Glassmorphism styling applied consistently
 Bento grid layouts on Homepage and Dashboard
 Accordion components functional
 60fps smooth animations on transitions
 Mobile-responsive (test on 375px, 768px, 1440px widths)
 Bottom nav on mobile, sidebar on desktop
 Emerald/Slate/Amber color palette throughout
 Haptic feedback on button presses (mobile)
 Loading states with shimmer skeletons
 Toast notifications styled
🚀 HANDOFF TO NEW AGENT
When starting a new conversation, say:

"Build Verdara outdoor recreation super-app exactly as specified in this handoff document. Start with Phase 1: Visual Mockup - 6 screens with full design implementation, mocked data, photorealistic images on ALL cards, glassmorphism UI, bento grids, and accordion components. Follow the design protocol EXACTLY - no deviations. The PostgreSQL database, Replit Auth, Object Storage, and OpenAI API are already configured."

Then attach this markdown file.

📞 CRITICAL REMINDERS
NO gray placeholder boxes - Every card must have a real photo
Earthy colors ONLY - Not Trust Layer cyan/lavender
Mobile-first - Build for phone screens first, then scale up
60fps animations - Use transform/opacity only, no layout thrashing
GarageBot - Motorized equipment ONLY (not firearms, climbing gear, etc.)
Team sports excluded - Outdoor recreation brand focus
TrustShield - ALL marketplace transactions use blockchain verification
DarkWave weather - Internal integration, not third-party API
Signal - Native asset language, NOT cryptocurrency
Build it all BEFORE first launch - No retrofitting allowed
END OF HANDOFF DOCUMENT

This document contains 5+ hours of collaborative planning. Preserve every detail during implementation.

Copy everything above into a file called VERDARA_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md and you're ready to start fresh with a new agent! 🌲✨
