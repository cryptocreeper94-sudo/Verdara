# Verdara Affiliate Program Directory

> **Last Updated:** February 2026
> **Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for signing up for affiliate programs to monetize Verdara's Price Compare feature.

---

## Overview

### How Affiliate Programs Work

Affiliate marketing is a performance-based revenue model where Verdara earns a commission for referring users to outdoor retailers. Here's the flow:

1. A Verdara user searches for gear on the **Price Compare** page
2. They click a retailer link (e.g., "Visit REI" or "Buy at Backcountry")
3. The link contains a unique affiliate tracking ID assigned to Verdara
4. A **cookie** is placed in the user's browser, tracking them for a set period (7-120 days depending on the retailer)
5. If the user purchases anything during the cookie window, Verdara earns a **commission** (typically 3-10% of the sale)
6. The affiliate network tracks the sale and pays Verdara monthly

### Revenue Model for Verdara's Price Compare Feature

The Price Compare page currently lists 10+ retailers across camping, hiking, fishing, hunting, climbing, cycling, water sports, and winter sports categories. Every "Visit Store" button should contain an affiliate link. With an average order value of $80-$150 for outdoor gear and commission rates of 3-8%, **each referred sale could generate $2.40-$12.00 in revenue**.

### Priority Order for Signup

1. **Sign up for affiliate networks first** (they host multiple brands under one account)
2. **Then apply to individual retailer programs** through those networks
3. **Finally, apply to direct programs** (Amazon Associates, etc.)

---

### How to Generate Affiliate Links

Each network has slightly different methods:

**Impact:**
- Use the "Create a Link" tool in the dashboard
- Paste any product URL to generate a tracked affiliate link
- Supports deep linking to specific product pages

**AvantLink:**
- Use the "Link Builder" tool
- Supports deep links, banner ads, and product feeds
- Product data feeds (CSV/XML) available for automated integration

**Awin/ShareASale:**
- Use the "Link Builder" tool in the dashboard
- Generate deep links to specific product pages
- Access banner ads and product feeds

**CJ Affiliates:**
- Use "Links" section in publisher dashboard
- "Get Links" button next to each advertiser
- Deep Link Generator for product-specific URLs

**Amazon Associates:**
- Use SiteStripe toolbar (appears at top of Amazon.com when logged in)
- Use Product Advertising API for programmatic link generation
- Use Associates Central dashboard for link creation

---

### How to Integrate Links into Verdara's Price Compare Feature

The Price Compare page currently has "Visit Store" buttons for each retailer. Here's how to integrate affiliate links:

1. **Replace plain retailer URLs with affiliate links**
   - Current: `url: "https://www.rei.com"`
   - Updated: `url: "https://www.rei.com?clickref=verdara&awc=XXXXX"` (format varies by network)

2. **Use server-side redirect approach (recommended)**
   - Create an API endpoint like `/api/affiliate/redirect?retailer=rei&product=osprey-atmos-65`
   - The endpoint looks up the correct affiliate link and redirects the user
   - This allows you to update affiliate links without redeploying the app

3. **Implement deep linking**
   - Instead of linking to retailer homepages, link to specific product pages
   - Deep links have higher conversion rates (user sees the exact product they're interested in)

4. **Track clicks internally**
   - Log which retailers users click on
   - Track conversion attribution (which Verdara feature led to the click)
   - This data helps optimize which retailers to promote

---

### Tracking and Reporting Basics

Each network provides a dashboard with:
- **Click tracking** - How many users clicked your affiliate links
- **Conversion tracking** - How many clicks resulted in purchases
- **Commission earned** - Total and per-transaction earnings
- **Pending vs. confirmed** - Commissions are typically pending for 30-60 days before confirmation
- **Reports** - Downloadable CSV/Excel reports for accounting

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- **EPC (Earnings Per Click)** - How much you earn per click on average
- **Conversion Rate** - Percentage of clicks that result in a purchase
- **Average Order Value** - How much customers spend per order
- **Commission Rate** - Your percentage of each sale

---

### Payment Setup and Thresholds

| Network | Minimum Payout | Payment Frequency | Methods |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Impact | Varies by brand | Monthly | ACH, PayPal, wire transfer |
| AvantLink | $50 | Monthly (2-month delay) | PayPal, ACH |
| Awin | $20 | Monthly, NET 30 | ACH, wire |
| ShareASale | $50 | Monthly, on the 20th | ACH, check, Payoneer |
| CJ Affiliates | $50 | Monthly, NET 20 | ACH, Payoneer, check |
| Rakuten | Varies | Monthly | ACH, check, PayPal |
| Amazon | $10 (ACH) / $100 (check) | Monthly, NET 60 | ACH, gift card, check |

## Implementation Notes for Verdara

### How to Structure Affiliate Links in the Price Compare Page

**Current Implementation** (in `client/src/pages/price-compare.tsx`):
```javascript
const retailers = [
  { name: "REI", letter: "R", url: "https://www.rei.com", ... },
  { name: "Bass Pro Shops", letter: "B", url: "https://www.basspro.com", ... },
  // etc.
];
```

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
const retailers = [
  {
    name: "REI",
    letter: "R",
    url: "/api/affiliate/redirect?retailer=rei",
    affiliateNetwork: "impact",
    commissionRate: "5%",
    cookieDuration: "15 days",
    // ...
  },
  // etc.
];
```

Create a server-side endpoint that:
1. Looks up the affiliate link for the requested retailer
2. Logs the click for analytics
3. Redirects the user to the affiliate-tagged URL
4. Handles fallback to non-affiliate URL if link is unavailable

### FTC Disclosure Requirements

**Required by law:** You must clearly disclose that Verdara earns commissions from affiliate links.

**Where to add disclosures:**
1. **Price Compare page** - Add a disclosure near the top: "Verdara may earn a commission when you purchase through links on this page. This doesn't affect the price you pay."
2. **Footer** - Add an "Affiliate Disclosure" link
3. **Product recommendations** - Any page that includes affiliate links needs disclosure
4. **Terms of Service** - Include affiliate relationship disclosure

**Example disclosure text:**
> "Verdara participates in affiliate programs with outdoor retailers. When you click a retailer link and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you. This helps support the development of Verdara's free features."

### Cookie Duration Strategy

Cookie duration affects your recommendation strategy:

| Cookie Duration | Strategy |
|----------------|----------|
| **24 hours** (Amazon) | Best for impulse purchases; show Amazon for low-cost accessories |
| **7-15 days** (REI, Bass Pro, Dick's) | Good for considered purchases; show these for mid-range gear |
| **30 days** (Backcountry, Simms, evo) | Best for high-value purchases; prioritize for expensive gear where users need time to decide |
| **60-120 days** (Survival Frog, Telluride Angler) | Excellent for high-ticket items; users can research and still attribute back to Verdara |

**Recommendation:** When displaying multiple retailers for the same product, prioritize retailers with longer cookie durations for expensive items, as users are more likely to research before buying.

### Deep Linking vs. Homepage Linking

| Approach | Conversion Rate | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Deep Linking** (link to specific product page) | Higher (3-8%) | When Verdara knows the exact product the user is looking for |
| **Category Linking** (link to category page) | Medium (1-3%) | When Verdara knows the activity but not the specific product |
| **Homepage Linking** (link to retailer home) | Lower (<1%) | Fallback only; avoid when possible |

**Recommendation:** Always deep link when possible. The Price Compare feature should ideally link users directly to the product they searched for on each retailer's site.
